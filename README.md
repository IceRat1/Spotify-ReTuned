# Spotify Retuned
 
## Description

As a lover of music, of course I use Spotify on a daily basis. However, I find that the Spotify interface isn't too great, and it can be pretty difficult to find information like my top songs or artist. So, I have created a 'ReTuned' version of Spotify, using the Spotify Web API, which can display all the information I want in a very easy to read interface.

## Features

### Spotify Web API Login

Connects to the Spotify Web API so the user can login to your Spotify account
